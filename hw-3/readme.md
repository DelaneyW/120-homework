["Hello world!" Sketch](https://delaneyw.github.io/120-homework/hw-3/index.html)


 # HW-3

 ## Introduction

 Through this week’s assignment I got acquainted with p5.js. First, I read and watched through a few videos explaining the history and applications of p5.js, then I downloaded the zip empty p5 project file containing a premade sketch file for me to work with, which meant I was ready to start playing around with it. I really enjoyed getting into the program this week and creating the “Hello World!” sketch. I particularly liked creating the background and exploring different shapes with p5.js.

## Work
To get rolling with p5.js I downloaded the empty p5.js file mentioned above, moved it into my repo and set it up by adding it to my new week-3 directory and renaming it "01_hello_world". Then I opened it up in atom and familiarized myself with the file anatomy. Finally I moved on to creating the "Hello World!" sketch.
I did this by entering in a text function and adding my "Hello Word!" text string. After that I learned about the setup, and draw functions and put them into action. Next I explored different 2-d shapes that I could create through p5.js and the code output function of the class website. I thought the quad was neat. I then practiced using comments on my code and learned how to create a background. Next, I created my final "hello world!" sketch complete with a light blue background. Lastly, I saved my work, committed it, fetched it, created a master branch through github pages for it, and linked it to my read.me.

## Problems
 I ran into a problem bringing my project into the browser. It slowed me down quite a lot. First I thought there was something wrong with my plug-in or my computer, and I tried a bunch of stuff to fix it. I tried uninstalling and re-installing my plug-in, restarting my computer, using someone else's computer. After talking to Michael I realized that I had just been trying to open the sketch file and not the index.html file.
