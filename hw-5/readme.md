# HW-5

## Introduction
To start off this week I was introduced to variables and basic animation in p5.js as well as the method for creating my own variables. I familiarized myself with the new variations such as mouseX/mouseY, width, height, and more. Lastly, before I transitioned into p5.js  I sketched out a rough draft of what I wanted my sketch to look like on graph paper.
## Work
For my animation I decided to create an interactive portrait of a face, and it was difficult getting all of the pieces to fit together. I ended up putting a lot of the work in the setup function to avoid drawing errors. I used a code based on an example in (Getting Started with p5.js pg. 96 example 6-4) to help with my eye animation. I created my own variable circleY to animate the hair on my portrait.  I used width and height twice in my sketch first to place the sun and then again at the bottom to display text of canvas measurements.
## Problems
I had a little bit of a hard time creating my own variable in the beginning, but eventually went back and watched the coding train video for help.
