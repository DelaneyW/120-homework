# HW-11
## Introduction
This week the assignment was to create a sketch using Object Orientated Programing. I had a really hard time this week working through the material. I had a hard time implementing all the separate parts of the OOP sketch. I leaned heavily on the videos and readings this week to figure out how to get a functioning sketch.
## Problems
I struggled a lot with this project. This project took me longer than any other one we have done this semester. I had an extremely hard time setting up the class and then calling on methods later.  I had to restart this project several times and ended up with a product that was very different than my initial plan.


## Sketch
I originally planned to create several fish that would move around the canvas. However, I ended but scrapping that do to time and difficulty implementing OPP. I began by creating an array and a variable globally. Then in Setup I set the background and set up a for loop for creating my shapes. After setting up the background in draw I used another for loop, I had to go back and follow along with coding train to figure out exactly how to do this. Then I declared the class and methods.
