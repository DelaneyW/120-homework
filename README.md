### Week 2 Homework
For this homework cycle we were asked to read through a brief explanation of text files, then create a file via command prompt, open it in a text editor and write our names and a sentence in the file. I didn't have any problem creating the file and opening it, writing in it and saving in atom.
### Exploration of Text Editor Uses
After I read through the Wikipedia page on text editors. I found it extremely helpful hearing all of the practical applications of certain word editors because it had seemed abstract to me.
 I installed atom on my computer previously, but I spent some extra time exploring the program and learning how it works. I went through and downloaded all the suggested packages and googled helpful packages for atom and ended up adding a few others including expose which is a file management package.
 ### Introduction to GIT Version Control.
  - Read the first three pages in Pro GIT-TOC. [Git-TOC E-Book link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
  2. Watched Videos on GIT Basics.
  3. Downloaded Github Desktop and selected run as administrator.

  ```After setting up Github Desktop with my account I learned how to use Github Desktop to create a repository for homework.```




  1. I navigated to file menu and selected new repository.
  2. Named the "file".
  3. Entered basic information about what the file was for.
  I used the "Choose" button to navigate to the place I wanted to store my repository.
  * Selected check-box for the purpose of creating a README file in my repository.
  * I created the repository via the "create repository" button.


  ### Making Commits via Github Desktop App
 - Opened repo in atom( I opened mine through Gethub Desktop)
 - Selected "REAdME" file
 - Typed a sentence into file using atom
 - Saved my file
 - Went back to Github Desktop
 - Saw blue dot indicating there were changes not yet commited.
 - Commited changes with a description of the changes made.

  **Ran through the process again and added a new file to the repo**
 - I used atom to create a new folder
 - Checked to make sure it had shown up on the left side of my text editor
 - I then used my terminal to move the test1.txt into my new folder
 - I opened the file in my text editor

    **Committing the New file and folder**

- Moved back over to Github Desktop
- Added a brief description of my changes
- And hit "Commit to master" button
- Explored Commit History

  To practice navigating the basic functions of Github Desktop I moved my closet directory into the repo, made changes, and committed them.
  ### Learned Basic Functions of Markdown
  - Read describtion of Markdown
  - Read and copied Markdown cheat sheet into file in atom
  -  Used "toggle command palette" to open preview of text displaying markdown language

"I then created a summary of my homework for this week using markdown language. I used the cheat sheet that I had copied into atom earlier to form lists, headings,a link,a inline code, and add an image file. I had a really hard time adding the image file. First I had trouble taking a screenshot, but I googled it and figured it out.
