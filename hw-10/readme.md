# HW-10

## Introduction

This week the assignment was to create two assignments using the array information we learned last week and the topic of this week creating our own functions, one assignment altering an old sketch and one creating a new one. I felt pretty comfortable using arrays in a loop after reading and watching the videos.

## Problems
But I struggled with understanding both the mechanical aspects and applying the lesson on functions. I had trouble assigning input parameters correctly. I also had trouble with the placement of the for loops. For quite a while I had placed one just outside of draw and eventually I did figure out that I just needed to move it which felt a little frustrating.

## Work
Once I got through all the readings and videos for functions I started on editing an old sketch.
##### Old Sketch
I ended up using my sketch from hw-6, but I messed around with a few other first before I moved to that one. I decided that I would create a function that would add to a shape I already had and turn it into a cloud shape in my sketch and re-use it in another location with different parameters. To integrate arrays, I decided to duplicate a circle I already had across the page using a for loop.
##### New Sketch
It took me some time playing around to figure out what I wanted to do with this project, but I ended up with a product that I like a lot. I set up two arrays at the top of the page, one for greyscale color variables and the other to use while placing points across the screen. Next, I created my own function called stripes with four input parameters. Then I used the rotate function to make the piece circular, repetitive and dynamic. Finally I applied the color array to the stripes I had made.
