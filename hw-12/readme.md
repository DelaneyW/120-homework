# HW-12
## Introduction
This week the assignment was to create a live sketch with interacting objects. At first, I found the mechanics of it a little tricky and re-watched each the Shiffman videos on the subject 3 or 4 times.
## Problems
Initially I wanted to give myself a challenge and create a quad, but I got over whelmed with the figuring out how to map it and used an ellipse instead. I also had a problem calling my orbs with a for loop and had to search through this weekâ€™s examples to find the solution to space them apart.

## Sketch
I wanted to create a sketch that would create a piece independently by having orbs interact and change in size, color and location. I feel happy with the piece. I first created a class "Orb" and assigned it methods, then I created a canvas, background, an array and a for loop. Then in draw I used another for loop to call orbs with their methods.
